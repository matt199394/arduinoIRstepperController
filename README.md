I had the problem of remotely controlling the volume of my home-built audio amplifier. For this purpose I created a circuit that allows me to control a stepper motor connected to the amplifier's potentiometer. The stepper motor can be controlled either using the remote control or the rotary encoder. I have to admit it works pretty well :)
I hope it's useful to someone!
